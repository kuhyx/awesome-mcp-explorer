// Maximally aggressive, type-aware flat config.
//
// Baseline is typescript-eslint's *type-checked* strict + stylistic presets, so
// anything they flag is an error, not a warning. On top of that: unicorn (all),
// sonarjs (cognitive complexity / duplicate logic), perfectionist (sorting), and
// react-hooks. Unused disable directives are themselves errors, so every
// `eslint-disable` in this repo must be load-bearing.
//
// Deliberately absent:
//   - eslint-plugin-react   : 7.37.x still calls context.getFilename(), removed in
//                             ESLint 10, so it crashes the run.
//   - eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y: 6.10.2 declares peer ESLint "^3 || ... || ^9" — no
//                             ESLint 10 support yet. a11y is enforced by review +
//                             testing-library queries (getByLabelText) instead.
//
// TypeScript is pinned to 6.0.x, not 7.x: typescript-eslint requires
// "typescript >=4.8.4 <6.1.0", and losing every type-aware rule would be a far
// bigger regression than gaining the Go-native compiler.
